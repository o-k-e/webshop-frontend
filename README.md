A full-stack webshop project built with modern technologies, developed for a real client and intended for live production use. The focus is on creating a secure, responsive, and containerized application that is easy to scale, extend, and maintain.

This project is **under active development** and intended for real deployment.

<br />


## üåê Live Demo

The webshop is deployed on [Render.com](https://render.com) and accessible at the following link:

[https://webshop-frontend-wl0h.onrender.com](https://webshop-frontend-wl0h.onrender.com)

> **Note:**  
> The first load may take **up to 30‚Äì60 seconds**, especially if the app hasn‚Äôt been accessed in a while.  
> This delay is due to [Render's free tier](https://render.com/docs/free#spin-down), which **automatically spins down inactive services** to save resources. When you revisit the site, it needs to "wake up" the backend and frontend containers before responding.

### üîê Access & Login Info

You can freely browse all **public user pages** (e.g. product listings, search, details) without logging in.

To access the **admin dashboard**, authentication is required.  
Use the following default admin credentials:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "Admin1@34"
}
```

Once logged in, you will be redirected to the protected admin interface.
